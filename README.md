# ðŸ§™ Calendar Wizard

Calendar Wizard is an AI Chrome extension that understands and creates events in Google Calendar for you. Tap "Create an Event with AI" under Create Event- then just write a description in the pop-up and you'll get the event ready to go. All you need is to click SAVE to get it onto your calendar.
